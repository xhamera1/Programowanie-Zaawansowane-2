## Lab 00: First C# .NET Framework Core 7.0 Console Applications

This lab introduces basic input/output operations in C# and the practice of implementing simple algorithms using the .NET Framework Core 7.0. **The main focus was on getting familiar with console input/output and implementing basic algorithms.**

## Lab 01: First C# .NET Framework Core 7.0 Console Applications

This lab focuses on further practice with C# console applications and file operations. **The key objective was to practice file operations and string manipulation within console applications.**

## Lab 02: Object-Oriented Programming in C# .NET Framework Core 7.0

This lab introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C# by building a simplified model for bank transactions. **The primary goal was to understand and implement object-oriented concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.**

## Lab 03: Working with Collections

This lab focuses on using collections in C# to process data read from a JSON file. **The main objective was to learn how to work with different collection types and perform operations like sorting, searching, and data transformation.**

## Lab 04: LINQ

This lab aims to familiarize students with Language Integrated Query (LINQ) for data manipulation in collections. **The core goal was to learn how to use LINQ to query and transform data from CSV files.**

## Lab 05: Concurrent Programming and Synchronization (Thread)

This lab introduces the concepts of concurrent programming and process synchronization using the `Thread` class in C#. **The main focus was on understanding how to create and manage threads, and how to synchronize access to shared resources.**   The lab included four key exercises: **Producer-Consumer Problem, Directory Monitoring, Asynchronous File Search, Thread Coordination.**

## Lab 06: Network Programming with TCP/IP Sockets

This lab introduces network programming concepts, specifically focusing on client-server communication using TCP/IP sockets. **The primary objectives included implementing fundamental TCP client-server communication, managing variable-length messages via a size-prefix protocol, and applying these concepts to create a basic remote directory navigation tool.**

## Lab 07: Basic cryptographic functions

This lab introduces basic cryptographic functions in C#. **The primary goal was to implement console applications for various cryptographic operations, including RSA and AES encryption, hash calculation (SHA256, SHA512, MD5), and RSA digital signatures, all with robust error handling.** Exercises covered RSA key management, file encryption/decryption, hash computation/verification, and digital signing/verification.

## Lab 08: SQLite

This lab focuses on SQLite database interaction in C#. **The main objective was to develop a program to load data from a CSV file into an SQLite table, automatically creating the table structure based on CSV content, and then displaying the data.** Tasks included CSV parsing, data type inference, dynamic table creation, and data population/querying.

## Lab 09: Basics of ASP.NET Core MVC - Controllers and Views

This lab introduces the fundamentals of building web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC, focusing on controllers and views. It covers user authentication through session management and interaction with an SQLite database. **The primary goal was to understand controllers, views, session management for user authentication, and interaction with an SQLite database, including storing hashed passwords using MD5**. Key tasks involved creating login/logout functionality, managing user sessions, restricting access based on login status, and performing data operations with SQLite.
