## Lab 00: First C# .NET Framework Core 7.0 Console Applications

This lab introduces basic input/output operations in C# and the practice of implementing simple algorithms using the .NET Framework Core 7.0. **The main focus was on getting familiar with console input/output and implementing basic algorithms.**

## Lab 01: First C# .NET Framework Core 7.0 Console Applications

This lab focuses on further practice with C# console applications and file operations. **The key objective was to practice file operations and string manipulation within console applications.**

## Lab 02: Object-Oriented Programming in C# .NET Framework Core 7.0

This lab introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C# by building a simplified model for bank transactions. **The primary goal was to understand and implement object-oriented concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.**

## Lab 03: Working with Collections

This lab focuses on using collections in C# to process data read from a JSON file. **The main objective was to learn how to work with different collection types and perform operations like sorting, searching, and data transformation.**

## Lab 04: LINQ

This lab aims to familiarize students with Language Integrated Query (LINQ) for data manipulation in collections. **The core goal was to learn how to use LINQ to query and transform data from CSV files.**

## Lab 05: Concurrent Programming and Synchronization (Thread)

This lab introduces the concepts of concurrent programming and process synchronization using the `Thread` class in C#. **The main focus was on understanding how to create and manage threads, and how to synchronize access to shared resources.** 

The lab included four key exercises:

1. **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Implementation of a multi-threaded producer-consumer model where n producer threads generate data and m consumer threads consume data, with thread-safe data sharing and comprehensive tracking of consumed items.
2. **Directory Monitoring**: Development of a real-time directory monitor that detects and reports file additions and deletions, utilizing separate threads for monitoring and user input handling.
3. **Asynchronous File Search**: Creation of a multi-threaded application that searches recursively through directories for files containing a specified substring, with search logic in a worker thread and result reporting handled by the main thread.
4. **Thread Coordination**: Implementation of a program that launches multiple threads, confirms their execution has begun, and coordinates their orderly shutdown, demonstrating proper thread lifecycle management.The lab included four key exercises: **Producer-Consumer Problem, Directory Monitoring, Asynchronous File Search, Thread Coordination**:
